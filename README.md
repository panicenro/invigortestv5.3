- invigortest

  -  I have chosen Laravel, as that is what I understood would be a good example to share since at invigor Laravel was being used

   - I have followed up normal laracast videos to self learn basics of laravel and found it quite easy to use, there is 1 html dependency used as suggested by laracast for forms. the rest was simple database crud operations which are simply available in any framework

   - I haven't been able to run the test suite thoroughly as I write this readme.

   - Since this was a new framework, it took about 3-4 hours for this task, I've tried it to be as simple as possible.

   - Compromises, Some testing has been taken care of, I need to enhance on TDD.
